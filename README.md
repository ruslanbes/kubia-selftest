# Selftest for Kubernetes in Action

- For each chapter read the questionsXX.md and try to figure out what was hidden with ??? placeholder
- Answers are in answersXX.md (`git diff` to check your answers)
- Some questions give hints about the answer e.g. `C??????S??????B?????` -> `ClusterServiceBroker`
- Some questions ask you "why?". You won't match the wording exactly, that's fine.
- Most questions have enough context to answer them independently - you don't need to read this book to answer them. You can test your Kubernetes Knowledge.
- If you find any errors (I'm pretty sure there are many), please create a Pull Request to this repo.
- Any suggestions (including if the questions were too hard/too easy) or applications are welcome.
